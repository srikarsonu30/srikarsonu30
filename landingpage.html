                                Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, it enshrines the tomb of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. 
                                 Its construction, lasting over two decades, involved an estimated 20,000 artisans and represents a fusion of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles.

                                  recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."</p>
